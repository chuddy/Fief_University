<h1>Fief University Overview</h1><h4>      By Carol Heim</h4><br>

<p>In 1984, concerned about the state of the world and its influence on youth, Sheikh Muhammad Al-Mansur Williams had a vision to effect change in the lives of these impressionable young people.  With faith in the leading of Allah, he took it upon himself to begin a school, whose purpose was to provide spiritual guidance in an academic environment, giving students the opportunity reach their potentials within the walls of this institution which promoted the three aspects of obedience to God through moral values and behavior, educational excellence, and physical development.  By l985 Sheikh Muhammad Williams had overcome daunting opposition and FIEF Academy had become a reality, now the oldest continually-operating private school in Nigeria.  In the intervening years it has proven itself a success as children from throughout the world have come to learn under the skilled teaching of dedicated teachers and other staff.  Others have recognized its excellence, as noted by various awards, two of which are the 2008 and 2009 National Quality School Awards given by the Quality Management Development Institute, Lagos, an annual honor given to those in the field of education who have demonstrated excellence.

<p>At the FIEF Academy students from Pre-School through High School are taught with attention to the whole person: their mental, spiritual, social, and physical well-being.  In a world of violence, moral corruption, political upheaval, and increasing lack of personal responsibility, the goal is to help these children develop into morally upright, educated adults, improving society as they become a contributing part of it.  It has been—and continues to be—our goal to help our students by not only the teaching of academics but also by providing a moral compass through spiritual instruction.  The success is reflected on the faces of students engaged in the learning process: whether their eyes are closed as they prayerfully worship, their brows are knit as they concentrate on their studies, or their mouths upturned in smiles and laughter as they joyously participle in get-togethers such as sports. There is no greater satisfaction for our staff than to see learning on all levels. This dedication to the whole person can result in graduates who possess the knowledge and character that allow them opportunities to have a voice not only in their future but in the world’s.

<p>And now the dream continues. Sheikh Mohammed Al-Mansur Williams could rest on the realization of his long-ago vision, but he has chosen not to. FIEF Academy has prepared students for the future, which in many cases means postsecondary studies, and the Sheikh sees the creation of a university as a natural extension of his passion for building lives through “moral training alongside academic” learning.  He has been encouraged in his aspirations to expand by his students’ parents, who desire a university setting with the same standards they have come to expect from the FIEF Academy.  In such an environment, Sheikh Williams sees young people continuing their tertiary studies with this same emphasis and is now preparing to provide equal excellence in education on a university level. His mission is two-fold: to provide this education for the graduates of FIEF Academy and on a greater scale, the people of the world. The Sheikh Muhammad Williams’ first endeavor is an online university, with a projected physical campus to complement it in five to ten years.  This virtual campus, the first one in the country of Nigeria, will benefit many: its lower tuition costs will enable those who cannot afford more costly schools; its flexibility will allow the working class to fit school into their schedules; its myriad courses will provide an opportunity for those with existing skills to update or change their areas of study; its world-wide availability gives rural students with little or no access to universities the chance to obtain an education; and its computer access allows students with disabilities the freedom to have equal footing with others.  In addition, in a world increasingly concerned with environmental issues, the virtual university is ecologically sound. There are no classrooms to heat and cool, libraries and computer labs are at the fingertips of students at their computers, and paper usage is at the discretion of the student. Online education is fast becoming the obvious, earth-friendly choice in the field of higher education.

<p>In analyzing the needs of a twenty-first century world, Sheikh Williams realized that there are major areas of study which should be addressed.  He has therefore visualized this school with both a traditional and a contemporary focus.  The traditional follows the format of teaching the arts, business, science, education, and majors found in most universities.  His second focus is that of agriculture.  In spite of the fact that about forty-four percent of the world’s population works in agriculture, food production does not keep up with demand.  Throughout the world, including Africa, food shortages threaten the health and—indeed the survival—of millions of people. The Sheikh desires to address this increasingly urgent problem with a University of Agriculture, providing the most up-to-date teaching and resources in the scientific, business, and technical ends of agricultural techniques.  His mission: To look at the future of the world centered on the availability of technical know-how in food production, especially as it affects Africa as a continent.

<p>Sheikh Muhammad Al-Mansur Williams is a man of compassion and courage who views his newest venture from the perspective of almost thirty-five years of experience starting and running a primary and secondary school in Lagos, Nigeria.  He desires to make his dream a reality with the help of other like-minded individuals.  There are opportunities for the following: those from any part of the world who would serve on a board of directors, educators to teach on-line classes, financial partners who believe that the future is their responsibility also, and those who make the technical part of it possible.  If you feel led to be part of this adventure into the changing of people’s lives, we encourage you to contact us.  After all, the university is to be a school for the world-wide village and those who work in it need not be limited by distance.  This is indeed an opportunity to have a voice not only in the futures of their students, but in the world’s future.

<p>Finally, through online learning, FIEF will provide global education in English, allowing students the flexibility to take courses at the convenience of their own schedules and locations; a computer and the internet are their only requirements.  FIEF will also provide two options for courses: self-improvement and credit.  The first allows a student to learn without external pressures.  The second will give college credit for completed course work. Online courses, also known as e-learning, as well as online universities, are the wave of the future, and FIEF is excited to be part of this next generation of instruction.  Our goal is to identify and provide the same excellence in teaching as has been demonstrated in the FIEF Academy.  Our objectives are the following: in a world of technology, we want to provide the next electronic specialists; in a world of political upheaval, we want to provide moral leadership; in a world of disease and illness, we want to provide medical treatment; in a world of hunger, we want to provide improved food sources; in a world of illiteracy, we want to provide educators; and in a world of hopelessness, we want to provide hope.
<p/><br>

<p>To reiterate, opportunity presents itself in the need for investors who are interested in a financial relationship.  FIEF is in the vanguard of an exciting entree in the collegiate experience and opens up avenues for those seeking partnerships to invest in the future of not only young people in Africa, but world-wide.  It offers a stake in the future: educating future business, political, societal, and agricultural leaders who, with a strong moral compass, can influence the world.  It is an opportunity to provide an avenue for future leaders to continue the dream of a world filled with hope, peace, and personal fulfillment, a place where people no longer watch their loved ones dying of starvation, and an opportunity to leave the world a better place in the future. Our vision is to allow young people the idea of a world in which they can dream—and a world in which dreams can be realized.  Are you willing to be part of our dream—and theirs?
